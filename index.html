        She came without a farthing

        A babe without a name

        So much ado about nothing

        So much ado, my lover

        So many games we played

        But, please, you must forgive me I am old but still a child All dead,
        all dead But I should not grieve In time it comes to everyone All dead,
        all dead But in hope, I breathe Of course, I don't believe You're dead
        and gone All dead and gone

        It's a kind of magic It's a kind of magic A kind of magic (No way) One
        dream, one soul One prize, one goal One golden glance of what should be
        It's a kind of magic One shaft of light that shows the way No mortal man
        can win this day It's a kind of magic The bell that rings inside your
        mind Is challenging the doors of time It's a kind of magic The waiting
        seems eternity

        The day will dawn of sanity (Ooh ooh ooh ooh) Is this a kind of magic?
        It's a kind of magic There can be only one This rage that lasts a
        thousand years Will soon be done This flame that burns inside of me I'm
        hearing secret harmonies It's a kind of magic The bell that rings inside
        your mind Is challenging the doors of time It's a kind of magic It's a
        kind of magic This rage that lasts a thousand years Will soon be, will
        soon be, will soon be done This is (this is) a kind (a kind) of magic
        (yeah) There can be only one (one, one, one) This rage that lasts a
        thousand years Will soon be done (done) Magic (it's a kind of magic)
        It's a kind of magic Magic magic magic (magic) (Magic) Aa ha ha haa,
        it's magic (Magic) It's a kind of magic
